# Welcome
I am a software engineering college student who likes to learn new things and dive deep into unfamiliar technology. I like to create new (albeit random) projects, but I'm a little lazy so there's probably not a crazy amount of activity on my profile. In fact, I log into Github maybe like 4 times a year. Anyways, I'm running out of interesting things to write here so here's a picture of a cat:
